* Features
- Searchable via tags or substring.
- Extremely minimal design, very easy to understand or extend.
- Basic Auth is included for mutate actions so it's possible to expose this site to the internet.
- Backed by a simple json file so data is transportable.

* Next Steps
- Add mutex protection for writes to json file backing service.
- Refactor logging.
- Needs unit tests.
- Documentation around everything
- Switch to key/value backend
  + brings some interesting challenges around search/indexing


* Ideas
Work towards making this a crowd sourced solution for curating the web.

Maybe a bunch of people could run their own services, there needs to be some protocol/standard for sharing link meta data.

Need to have a way to validate contributions, each person could be asked to moderate a given number of other contributions with some known bad contributions included. If they successfully identify the known bad contributions it could be assumed that their contribution is good. There could be some threshold of reviews before a contribution is committed.

Combine above with ML to classify new sites, basicaly have users train and refine a model.
